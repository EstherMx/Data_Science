Python Functions
Simply put, a function is a series of steps executed as a single unit and “encapsulated” under a single name. It is a group of statements capable of performing some tasks.

A function in a program can take arguments (that is, the data to operate on) and can optionally return some data after performing the intended task. Creating a function is basically giving your computer well-defined instructions to perform a task.

range10 = range(10)
for i in range10:
  print(i, end=' ')  // end=' ' will print the result on one line and leave a space bwtween each i

ie:
print('========================')
friends = [ 'jo', 'glenn', 'sally']
for friend in friends:
  print('this is my friend:', friend)
for i in range(len(friends)):    // i the number of rang(3) since len(friends = 3) 
  friend_info = friends[i]
  print('this their id:', i, friend_info)
