the software contains the CPU and main memory
central processing unit: ask 'what to do next?' is fast
main or primary memory: fast small temporary storage- ie: RAM(Random Access Memory), which is primary-volatile memory
ie: ROM(Read Only Memory) is a primary-non volatile memory. When they are running, programs are stored in the main memory

secondary memory: slower large permanent storage - disk drive/ memory stick, ie: HDD(Hard Disk Drive), SSD(Solid State Drive) and RAM ()
input devices:keyboard, mouse, touch screen
 output devices: screen, speakers, printer

the brain of the computer is the central processing unit with pins 
64 pins asks what we want to do.print

All the instructions are kept in the main memory
which feeds the CPU with instructors. 


the 2nd memory will save everything even when the power is off.

capacitor, resistor and transitors are tinier on a microprocessor (r: image)

 ROM are usually hard-coded into the hardware itself, and cannot be changed or deleted. As for HDD and SSD, these are just storage devices used to store user and OS data, like movies, music, Windows files, etc. ROM is usually not read even by the OS, it's a very low-level storage which can't be easily accessed.
