Stats at work!

Instead of a case-by-case basis, lawyer Elaine Shoben used statistics to show that discrimination was at play in hiring women. It was then on the company to prove or change their hiring process to avoid legal..

Step 1: 
Could the hiring results have happened by random chance? Or is that statistically impossible? - ie: a company has 40% women applying but only 10% of the total workers are women.

Step 2:
If the hiring results haven't happened by chance, they must have happened by 'purposeful' exclusion.

Step 3:
If the employer is aware of this 'pruposeful exclusion', they show 'reckless disregard' for the rights of individual candidates not to be discriminated against.

Step 4; 
The burden of proof shifts to the employer to prove why hiring requirements are valid and necessary.
