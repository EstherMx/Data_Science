Stats at work!

Instead of a case-by-case basis, lawyer Elaine Shoben used statistics to show that discrimination was at play in hiring women. It was then on the company to prove or change their hiring process to avoid legal..

Step 1: 
Could the hiring results have happened by random chance? Or is that statistically impossible? - ie: a company has 40% women applying but only 10% of the total workers are women.

Step 2:
If the hiring results haven't happened by chance, they must have happened by 'purposeful' exclusion.

Step 3:
If the employer is aware of this 'pruposeful exclusion', they show 'reckless disregard' for the rights of individual candidates not to be discriminated against.

Step 4; 
The burden of proof shifts to the employer to prove why hiring requirements are valid and necessary.


On January 28, 1986, the Challenger space shuttle exploded, killing its 7 crew members. The explosion was caused by a failure of two O-rings: small rubber rings that helped create an airtight seal between the space shuttle and its launch fuel supply. Before the launch, engineers were concerned about how the low-temperature forecast would affect the O-ringsâ€™ ability to make a proper seal.

Engineers made their arguments using data visualizations that the launch should be postponed. Unfortunetely, their visualizations were based by launch date instead of temperature, which could have shown that under a certain temperature there was a 50% chance of failure.
