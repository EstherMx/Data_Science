               Data Science Roadmap  

Part 1 - Data Processing with SQL, Python and R
•   Extract data from a database (SQL)
•   Clean, manipulate, analyze data (Python or R)
•   Visualize data 
   Source: Dataquest (sql fundamentals), Datacamp (intro to sql), the book Storytelling with Data by Cole Knaflic (visualization story)
Dig deeper: intermediate and advanced concepts, such as,
•   Handling NULL with COALESCE
•   sub-queries and their impact on the query’s efficiency
•   Temporary tables
•   Self joins
•   Window functions like PARTITION, LEAD, LAG
•   User defined functions.
•   Use of indexes in querying to make operations faster

Part 2 – Mathematics, Probability and Statistics
Probability:
•   The concept of “independent events” (foundation, most used)
•   The counting Rule
•   Discrete random variables
•   Continuous random variables
•   Bayesian inference
•   Limit theorems
•   Classical Statistics
•   Courses:
   Khan Academy’s Statistics and Probability (High school level)
   HarvardX’s Data Science – Probability (PH125.3x) on Data camp  (college level – gentle intro in R)
   HarvardX Stat 110: Introduction to Probability (College / Graduate level)
   MITx 6.431 Probability — The Science of Uncertainty and Data (College / Graduate Level)
Videos: 
   StatQuest with John Starmer on YouTube
   Discrete Math Series by Dr Trefor Bazett on YouTube (containing concepts in probability)

   Seeing Theory: https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/basic-probability/index.html

Apply probability with R or Python:
   Take a class in A/B testing, an important skill for a data scientist. https://www.udacity.com/course/ab-testing--ud257
To understand such statistical tools, one needs to build a strong foundation in probability. A data scientist must understand probability concepts before making a proper sampling plan. Probability forms the foundation of machine learning.

Part 3 – Computer Science Fundamentals
Python:
•   Variables
•   Datatypes
•   Loops
•   Functions
•   If statements
•   OOP
•   Dictionary
•   Linked lists
•   Queues
•   Heaps
•   Trees
•   Graphs
•   Monty Python

Part 4 – Machine Learning

Lexico: R is a collection of useful packages to organize, manipulate and visualize data: gglplot2 (for data visualization), dplyr (for data manipulation) and stringr ( for string manipulation).
