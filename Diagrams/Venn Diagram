Venn Diagram
The union of two sets encompasses any element that exists in either one or both of them. We can represent this visually as a venn diagram as shown. Union is often represented as:

(A\ or\ B)(A or B)
A Venn diagram that shows two overlapping circles, one that represents event A and one that represents event B. Both of these circles are shaded blue.

The tree diagram shown displays an example of the multiplication rule for independent events.
