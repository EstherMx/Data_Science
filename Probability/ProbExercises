ProbExercises


Probability in Python for P(A or B):

def prob_a_or_b(a, b, all_possible_outcomes):
   	# probability of event a
  prob_a = len(a)/len(all_possible_outcomes)
	
	# probability of event b
  prob_b = len(b)/len(all_possible_outcomes)
	
	# intersection of events a and b
  inter = a.intersection(b)
	
	# probability of intersection of events a and b
  prob_inter = len(inter)/len(all_possible_outcomes)

  	# write a return statement that returns the probability of events a or b occuring
 	# P(A or B) with intersection = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) //P(A and B): is the intersection, events are both in A and B
  return prob_a + prob_b - prob_inter
