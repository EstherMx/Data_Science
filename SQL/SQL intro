SQL intro
A table, known as relation, is a collection of data organized into rows and columns. 

A column is a set of data values of a particular type. Here, id, name, and age are the columns.

A row is a single record in a table. 


ALTER vs INSER INTO vs UPDATE

ALTER TABLE celeb
ADD COLUMN net_worth INT;
//here ALTER TABLE changes the structure of the table by adding a new column. Since we haven't added any new values, net_worth column will return âˆ… (NULL) for each celeb.  

INSER INTO celeb (id INT, name TEXT, age INT)
VALUES (1, 'Adele', 30),
(2, 'John Legend', 41),
(3, 'Henry Cavell', 45);
// here INSER INTO will add new values or rows to an already exiting table with columns.

UPDATE celebs
SET net_worth = 5000000
WHERE name = 'Henry Cavell';
//here UPDATE modifies the existing data stored in the table/database. SET refers to a column and WHERE refers to a specific row.
